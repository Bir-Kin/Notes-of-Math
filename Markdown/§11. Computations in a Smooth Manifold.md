###	 The Normal Bundle

**TUBULAR NEIGHBORHOOD THEOREM 11.1.** 
There exists an open neighborhood of $ M $ in $ A $ which is diffeomorphic to the total space of the normal bundle under a diffeomorphism which maps each point $ x $ of $ M $ to the zero normal vector at $ x $. 

**COROLLARY 11.2.** 
If $M$ is <span style="color:red">closed</span> in $A$, then the cohomology ring $H^*(E, E_0; \Lambda)$ associated with the normal bundle of $M$ in $A$ is canonically isomorphic to the cohomology ring $H^*(A, A - M; \Lambda)$. 
<span style="color:gray">Here $\Lambda$ can be any coefficient ring.</span> 

**THEOREM 11.3.** 
If $M$ is embedded as a closed subset of $A$, then the composition of the two restriction homomorphisms  
$$
H^k(A, A - M) \to H^k(A) \to H^k(M),
$$
with mod 2 coefficients, maps the fundamental class $u'$ to the top Stiefel-Whitney class $w_k(\nu)$ of the normal bundle. Similarly, if $\nu^k$ is oriented, then the corresponding composition with integer coefficients maps the integral fundamental class $u'$ to the Euler class $e(\nu^k)$. 



### The Tangent Bundle

**LEMMA 11.5.** 
 The normal bundle $\nu^n$ associated with the diagonal embedding of $M$ in $M \times M$ is canonically isomorphic to the tangent bundle $TM$ of $M$. 

**LEMMA 11.6.** 
Any orientation for the tangent bundle $\tau_{M}$ gives rise to an orientation for the underlying topological manifold $M$, and conversely any orientation for $M$ gives rise to an orientation for $\tau_{M}$. 

**LEMMA 11.7,** 
The class $u' \in H^n(M \times M, M \times M - \Delta(M))$ is uniquely characterized by the property that its image $j_x^*(u')$ is equal to the preferred generator $u_x$ for every $x \in M$.
